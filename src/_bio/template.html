              I'm a <span id="age"></span> year old dude living Malm√∂, Sweden.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up I wanted to be super hero, unfortunately I quickly found out that
              lacking any kind of superpower (unless you count my amazing ability to injure myself doing any type of training)
              I had to settle for another career. After a few twists turns I ended up in software.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not gonna lie to you and brag that I'm an expert in this or that.
              The fact of the matter is that I'm a jack of all trades. I've done a bit of everything,
              both when it comes to code stacks and job positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not working, I like to run, make and eat burgers and listen to audio books.
              I've tried doing all of it at the same time, but it got messy. (2/5 would not recommend)
