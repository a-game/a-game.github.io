## Overview

In the autumn of 2021, Logitech aimed to harness its market position as a leading provider of video conferencing equipment and desk peripherals to create a comprehensive desk and room booking solution, code named “Aladdin”.
The project spanned numerous cross-functional teams, multiple departments, and various time zones. It entailed a comprehensive approach involving both hardware and software initiatives.

We developed a wide array of components, including native applications for mobile and desktop platforms, device firmware, administrative tools, and analytical instruments. These were all supported by a resilient microservices architecture created to ensure scalability and security.

Throughout this journey, we navigated the balance between hardware-related schedules and constraints, and maneuvered through diverse technological stacks to create a cohesive solution.
Addressing communication challenges within the organization, we established clear channels, regular updates, and strategic collaboration points, fostering unity among stakeholders and goals.

This effort demonstrated how hardware, technology variety, and good communication interact in a large organization, where success comes from coordinated innovation and achievement.
