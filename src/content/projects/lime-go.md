Lime Go is an innovative CRM application renowned for seamlessly integrating comprehensive Nordic company data and essential decision-maker information. This distinctive offering comes complete with potent search and filtering tools, empowering users to navigate the wealth of data at their fingertips.
My introduction to web development and SaaS occurred through Lime Go, a Single Page Application (SPA) built on cutting edge (for the time) web infrastructure, featuring microservices in Docker containers, ASP.NET Core, and ES6.

My journey with Lime Go evolved as I took on the role of Product Manager during its shift from introduction to growth phase. This transition focused on boosting user acquisition, minimizing churn, and propelling the product toward self-sufficiency. Guided by the initial brand traction, I concentrated on strategic product positioning, ensuring Lime Go not only delivered exceptional value to customers but also stood out in a highly competitive market landscape.
