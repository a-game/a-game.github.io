Hope you're having a wonderful day :)

The entire point of this "blog" is for me to be able to google my own thoughts. In fact I will immediately stop calling it a blog, because that might set some expectations on regular updates or maybe comments and notifications.

I'm just going to try to write things that I've learned and want to remember, or just stuff that I find interesting.

If you've found this and you're not me, well I hope you find some of this stuff interesting too. Otherwise go check out the latest [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) or something.
