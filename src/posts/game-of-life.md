I was recently working on a project where we used [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) to build web components in react. During that I saw that [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) can compile directly to custom elements as of version 1.37.

So I decided to try it out.

The code for this component can be found [on my github.](https://github.com/a-game/svelte-game-of-life)
