I recently saw that one could use `MDX` to import and display react components in Gatsby markdown pages.

So I decided to try it out.

Below is a component that simulates [Schelling's segregation model.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation)

The code for the component can be found [on my github.](https://github.com/a-game/schellings-model)

***

import Simulation from "schellings-model-sim";

<Simulation />
