                <p>
                  After working as developer for four years, I got offered a
                  position as a product manager at Lime. That sounded like fun
                  and I wanted to try it out. One big advantage to going from
                  development to product is that it gave me a huge advantage
                  when communicating with developers and consultants who deliver
                  our products. It was also great when talking to technical
                  customers, partners using our API:s and our tech support.
                  However, It wasn't all good. One of the big challenges for me,
                  was focusing on the "problem space" and not the "solution
                  space", that is something that I have to actively think about.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my time as a PM I worked with Lime products targeting
                  sales and marketing market segments. This thought me quite a
                  lot about those domains.

                  Lime is the swedish market leader on CRM. They develop, sell,
                  deliver and support their CRM products. This is quite great if
                  you are a developer, because you are always close to the
                  actual user. You direct input from users when developing new
                  features, and quick feedback when something breaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I joined Lime when the development department was still quite
                  small so I got a chance to work on all of their three CRM
                  products. I later took lead on gracefully moving users from
                  their oldest legacy product, Lime Easy, to the other two; Lime
                  Go which is a Sales focused CRM system for smaller companies
                  and Lime CRM which is Limes flagship platform.

                  helping other students with programming classes. This was fun
                  and useful because in order to hold a lecture about

                  courses as I could. I started an degree in engineering and

            <p>
              Lime CRM is an interesting product, with a really bad name. It's
              not really a CRM at all. It's more like a platform for building
              data manipulation tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Out of the box, what you get is a relational database, a web API
              that can serve the data, a client that can visualize the data and
              some micro services that can do other things with the data. For
              example there is a search engine that can make the data searchable
              and message queue that can tell you when the data has changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cool thing is that all of this stuff is extendable and
              customizable. You can specify your own personal schema and object
              names, which will then be available in the API, and so on. You
              could even write your own custom API endpoint with your own
              business logic and extend the web client using Web Components to
              visualize and interact with the data in your own way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although this was not my main job at the time, I learned a lot by
              testing and building small add-ons (which is a packaged
              combination of the aforementioned customizations). Imagine
              building a React app with the dev team in the room next door.{" "}

              Go was my first real experience with web development and working
              with SaaS. Go is a SPA built on modern web infrastructure with
              micro services running in docker containers, an ASP.NET server,

            <p>
              The crux with this product was that it had a hefty amount of data,
              that was to be made searchable and available to the user. Both
              using the web client and the API for integrations. Storing
              commonly used information in a quick search engine and lazy
              loading more data on demand, in combination with a graphQL API
              where you have to explicitly ask for the information you want is
              great for this purpose.

              Easy is the first "real life" software product I've worked on so
              maybe it's not so surprising that it taught me the most.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I started working with Lime Easy, the objective was to take a
              very popular product and modernize it. Both in terms of tech stack
              and in terms of visual design. Later the objective shifted towards
              just maintaining the product and move users to Limes other
              products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lime Easy is a Win32 program written in C++ by a tight group of
              developers over 20 years. Oh, and with no tests to speak of. It's
              safe to say it had quite a few pitfalls and caveats. It was not
              trivial to add or alter functionality without breaking something
              else. The book{" "}
              <Link to="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780131177055/samplepages/0131177052.pdf">
                "Working Effectively With Legacy Code" by Michael C. Feathers{" "}
              </Link>
              was of great help when trying to figure this out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people may cringe at the thought of working with Win32 and
              COM, but I'm very glad I did. Concepts like the Windows message
              loop are borrowed and reused in modern frameworks like Redux. COM
              was one of the earliest attempts at cross platform,
              language-neutral communication between software programs. At it's
              essence it's quite an elegant way to have a self documenting API.
