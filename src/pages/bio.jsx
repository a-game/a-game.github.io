                Growing up I wanted to be super hero, unfortunately I quickly
                found out that lacking any kind of superpower (unless you count
                my amazing ability to injure myself doing any type of physical
                activity) I had to settle for another career. After a few twists
                turns I ended up in software.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not gonna lie or brag to be an expert at this or that. The
                fact of the matter is that I'm a jack of all trades. I've done a
                bit of everything, both when it comes to code stacks and job
                positions.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not working, I like to run, boulder, eat burgers and
                listen to audio books. I've tried doing all of it at the same
                time, but it got messy. (2/5 would not recommend)
