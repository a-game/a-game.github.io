                        I'm a curious and observant fellow, who likes to solve problems and figure out how things
                        really work.

                        I'm a <span id="age"></span> year old dude living Malm√∂, Sweden, where I was
                            born and spent the first nine years of my life. At the age of nine I moved to Cairo with my
                            dad, where I spent another nine years in a metropolis that never sleeps.
                    </p>

                    <p class="column-text">
                        Growing up in such a huge city taught me alot about diplomacy and handeling people, because you
                        are surrounded by them all the time.
                        Another important feature I've gained from my years in Cairo is coping with stress and a life
                        of fast pace.

                    <p class="column-text">
                        When I turned eighteen I decided to move back to Sweden in order to continue my
                        education.
                        I had a slight problem however, I didn't really know what I wanted to do.

                    <p class="column-text">
                        I have two passions in life, solving problems and understanding how things tick.
                        At a young age I used to take my dad's old gadgets, take them apart and try to draw up diagrams
                        of how then were constructed and why it behaves in a certain way when you press one button or
                        another.
                        This led me to the realization that I wanted to do something technical, probably something with
                        computers which I found particularly fascinating. I've always been good with people though so I
                        really wanted to have some social aspect to my line of work.
                    </p>

                    <p class="column-text">In 2008 my search was put to rest as I found a great program at Lund University that to
                        combines the technical and social aspects of computer science.
                        I immediately applied, got accepted and graduated in 2011.

                    <p class="column-text">I'm a guy with many interests, and a very particular taste in movies, so I always have
                        a lot going on.
