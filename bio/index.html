              I'm a curious and observant fellow, who likes to solve problems and figure out how things
              really work.
            </p>

            <span class="divider"></span>

            <p class="column-text">
              I'm a <span id="age"></span> year old dude living Malmö, Sweden, where I was
              born and spent the first nine years of my life. At the age of nine I moved to Cairo with my
              dad, where I spent another nine years in a metropolis that never sleeps.
            </p>

            <p class="column-text">
              Growing up in such a huge city taught me a lot about diplomacy and handling people, because you
              are surrounded by them all the time.
              Another important feature I've gained from my years in Cairo is coping with stress and a life
              of fast pace.
            </p>

            <p class="column-text">
              When I turned eighteen I decided to move back to Sweden in order to continue my
              education.
              I had a slight problem however, I didn't really know what I wanted to do.
            </p>
            <p class="column-text">
              I have two passions in life, solving problems and understanding how things tick.
              At a young age I used to take my dad's old gadgets, take them apart and try to draw up diagrams
              of how then were constructed and why it behaves in a certain way when you press one button or
              another.
              This led me to the realization that I wanted to do something technical, probably something with
              computers which I found particularly fascinating. I've always been good with people though so I
              really wanted to have some social aspect to my line of work.
            </p>

            <p class="column-text">I'm a guy with many interests, and a very particular taste in movies, so I always
              have
              a lot going on.
              My interests include running, gaming, sketching and talking to complete strangers. If you're
              ever sitting next to me on the buss, don't hesitate to say Hi!

            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up I wanted to be super hero, unfortunately I quickly found out that
              lacking any kind of superpower (unless you count my amazing ability to injure myself doing any type of training)
              I had to settle for another career. After a few twists turns I ended up in software.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not gonna lie to you and brag that I'm an expert in this or that.
              The fact of the matter is that I'm a jack of all trades. I've done a bit of everything,
              both when it comes to code stacks and job positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not working, I like to run, make and eat burgers and listen to audio books.
              I've tried doing all of it at the same time, but it got messy. (2/5 would not recommend)
