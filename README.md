My personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Note

svgo 2.8.0 is not actually used by this repo, however it is used by astro-icon and the build fails unless it has that exact version [according to this](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon/pull/76)

Remove it once astro-icon is updated.
