              <h4>Product manager - Lime Technologies</h4>
              <p>
                After working as developer for four years, I got offered a position as a product manager at Lime.
                That sounded like fun and I wanted to try it out. One big advantage to going from development to product
                is that it gave me a huge advantage when communicating with developers and consultants who deliver our products.
                It was also great when talking to technical customers, partners using our API:s and our tech support.
                However, It wasn't all good. One of the big challenges for me, was focusing on the "problem space" and not the
                "solution space", that is something that I have to actively think about.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my time as a PM I worked with Lime products targeting sales and marketing market segments. This thought me quite a lot
                about those domains.

              <h4>Software developer - Lime Technologies</h4>
              <p>
                Lime is the swedish market leader on CRM. They develop, sell, deliver and support their CRM products.
                This is quite great if you are a developer, because you are always close to the actual user.
                You direct input from users when developing new features, and quick feedback when something breaks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I joined Lime when the development department was still quite small so I got a chance to work on all of their three CRM products.
                I later took lead on gracefully moving users from their oldest legacy product, Lime Easy, to the other two; Lime Go which is a Sales
                focused CRM system for smaller companies and Lime CRM which is Limes flagship platform.

                After starting a few programs, I finally finished a degree in software development. What's cool about

                During my studies, I worked for Lund university as a tutor, helping other students with programming
                classes. This was fun and useful because in order to hold a lecture about programming, I had to read
                up and really try to understand the concepts we were taught.

                At this point of my life, I couldn't really decide on what I wanted to do. To solve that problem
                I just enrolled to as many courses as I could. I started an degree in engineering and another in
                finance,
                but I didn't finish any of them. I did however learn about physics, mathematics and accounting.
